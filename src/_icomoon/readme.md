Drop all the contents of an icomoon package into this folder and it will automatically copy the font files to the correct locations for you and generate the necessary sass required for Swordion to work.

Ensure that Sass variables is turned on before downloading.

To turn on Sass variables, there is a gear next to the "download" button when on the Font screen. Click it and a menu will appear. Check the "Generate Stylesheet Variables for:" checkbox then ensure "sass" is selected.

None of the files in this folder are actually used for anything other than as a source for the icomoon_unpackager grunt task. It is also the only place where you can find the selection.json file (the file that lets you load the projects icon font into Icomoon).
